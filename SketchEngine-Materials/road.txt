I never hyperventilate, quite the opposite – I breathe slowly as if I’m too exhausted to be able to lift my chest up.. . There’s no blind panic, just really bad central chest pain like someone’s sitting on my chest so I pull the seat belt outwards or take my seatbelt off as if feels like my seat belt is crushing me. . . I get it in stressful situations like traffic jams along a busy road or it just comes on with no trigger, or sometimes even over a < bump in a road in > town. . . They only thing I can think of is my body gets too ‘excited’ overtaking cars along a busy motorway and triggers it?.
