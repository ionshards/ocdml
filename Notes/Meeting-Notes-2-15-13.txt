Questions:

Handling cross-sections
Axial naming conventions (polar vs. top/ bottom/ â€¦ )
Handling coercion (coercion attribute to configuration link? "FIG-GROUND" or "GROUND-FIGURE")
Primitive disambiguation (Cube vs. Slab, Slab vs. 4-gon, etc.)
Handling projections (are they spatial entities? should they be ignored? are they another entity type?)

Decisions:

Tag only heads for nominal entities
Top/Bottom may leave Front/Back and Left/Right unspecified; lateral axes automatically assign others
Primitives may specify necessarily intrinsic dimensions (cones have tops)
