**Outline of Configuration/ Orientation Relations**

SPATIAL_ENTITY (inherit all attributes from ISO-space)
mod (a descriptor)
primitiveType ( cube | sphere | disc | torus | plane | cylinder | annulus | n-gon | ... )
dimensionality ( 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 )

***Notes:***
For each primitive, a number of surfaces, edges, and corners should be enumerated in the guideline, e.g.
Cube:
6 surfaces,
12 edges,
8 corners

Primitives can have directionality, e.g.
Z-directed cube: the intrinsic "top" is on the z-axis
These will probably be tied directly to primitive types.
