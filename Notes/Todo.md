1. Further changes to `SPATIAL_ENTITY`
    1. With split antecedents in cases like "X and Y face each other" we don't want to annotate 'other' as a `SPATIAL_ENTITY`, but rather capture the relation directly faces(X,Y) and faces(Y,X). In cases like "X and Y are standing together. They are facing the wall." we do want to annotat 'they' as a `SPATIAL_ENTITY` to be able to capture the faces(they,wall).
    1. "He looked at himself in the mirror" example where he(front)-to-himself(front) & himself(back)-to-mirror(front)
