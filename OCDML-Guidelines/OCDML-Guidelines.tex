\subsection{Spatial Entity} % (fold)
\label{sub:spatial_entity}

The \texttt{spatial\_entity} tag in \ML is intended to identify participants of spatial relations. In order to be considered a participant in a spatial relation, the entity must be located in real-space. For this annotation task, annotators should ignore any entities that exist within metaphorical spaces. For instance, a metaphrical-space is introduced in \Cref{ex:hit_song}, so, although \emph{song} and \emph{charts} could be considered spatial entities, they should be ignored for this task. Note, however, that metaphorical-spaces are distinct from fictional-spaces, such as in \Cref{ex:enter}. For the purposes of this task, annotators should the fictional-space that is associated with the diagesis of a play, film or other literary work, to be a real-space. For instance, in \Cref{ex:enter}, annotators should consider \emph{PAMELA}, \emph{door}, and \emph{staircase} to be spatial entities.

\eenumsentence{
    \item The hit song is on top of the charts.
    \label{ex:hit_song} % We should look for a metaphorical example from our corpus.
    \item Enter \entity{PAMELA}{1} from the \entity{door}{1} in front of the \entity{staircase}{1}, \ldots
    \label{ex:enter}
}\label{ex:metaphorical_fictional_spaces}

\subsubsection{Spatial Entity Extents} % (fold)
\label{ssub:spatial_entity_extents}

For this task, the textual extents that should be tagged with the \textsc{spatial\_entity} tag will be nouns. In terms of grammatical dependencies, only the heads of noun phrases should be captured with the \textsc{spatial\_entity} tag. Spatial entities may occur in nominal or named forms, and both are valid extents for this tag type. In the case of multi-word proper names, the entire extent of the name should be included in the tag. In terms of a dependency phrase-structure, sister words and phrases of head nouns should not be included in \textsc{spatial\_entity} tag extents. Refer to \Cref{ex:spatial_entity} in \cref{ssub:spatial_entity_examples} for illustrations of various \textsc{spatial\_entity} extent tags.

\subsubsection{Spatial Entity Attributes} % (fold)
\label{ssub:spatial_entity_attributes}

The \ML \textsc{spatial\_entity} tag inherits some attributes from other annotation schemes, but only a subset of these attributes are relevant for this task. The attributes which annotators should annotate for this task are \texttt{dimensionality}, \texttt{line\_type}, \texttt{area\_type}, \texttt{volume\_type}, \texttt{left\_right}, \texttt{front\_back}, \texttt{top\_bottom}, and \texttt{c-sec\_axis}. Annotators do not need to tag the other attributes that are defined in the Document Task Definition, including \texttt{form}, \texttt{latLong}, \texttt{mod}, \texttt{countable}, \texttt{amount}, \texttt{quant}, \texttt{scopes}.

\end{attributes}
\caption{\textsc{spatial\_entity} Attributes}
\label{tab:spatial_entity}
\end{table}

\paragraph{\texttt{dimensionality}} % (fold)
\label{par:dimensionality}
This attribute is used to designate the number of spatial dimensions occupied by the entity. For the purposes of \ML annotation, take spatial entities to be point-sets. As such, a value of \textsc{point} indicates a 0-dimensional entity consisting of a single point with no edges or surfaces. A value of \textsc{line} indicates a 1-dimensional entity with up to two bounding points, or vertices, with a single edge and no surfaces. A value of \textsc{area} indicates a 2-dimensional entity with some number of bounding edges, points and two surfaces. A value of \textsc{volume} indicates a 3-dimensional entity with at least one surface and possibly a number of bounding edges and points.

If a value of \textsc{point} is specified for a \textsc{spatial\_entity} tag, then it is not necessary to specify the other attributes, since they are not relevant to 0-dimensional entities. If a value of \textsc{line} is specified, then the \texttt{line\_type} attribute must be filled. If a value of \textsc{area} is specified then at least the \texttt{area\_type} attribute must be filled, and the \texttt{line\_type} could be filled with whatever would be appropriate if the entity were coerced to a line for the purposes of participating in a relation. Finally, if the the \textsc{volume} type is specified, then at least the \texttt{volume\_type} attribute must also be filled, and the \texttt{area\_type} and \texttt{line\_type} attributes might also be filled.

\begin{note}
Although annotators must choose a single value for the \texttt{dimensionality} attribute, spatial entities may be coerced to different dimensionalities depending on the spatial relations they are participating in. E.g., a \emph{door} might be considered volumetric, however it may be coerced to 2-dimensions when participating in some relationships. In that case, it would be appropriate to fill both the \texttt{volume\_type} and \texttt{area\_type} attributes. Refer to \Cref{sub:configuration_link} for more discussion of this type of coercion.
\end{note}

% paragraph dimensionality (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{line\_type}} % (fold)
\label{par:line_type}
This attribute is used to classify the entity based on a set of 1-dimensional primitive types. Some lexical items that are good candidates for the \texttt{line\_type} value of \textsc{segment} would be a \emph{clothesline}, a piece of \emph{wire}, or a singular strand of \emph{hair}. These are examples of linear entities which have distinguishable endpoints. We include the \textsc{ray} type to capture entities such as a \emph{ray} of light that would have only one distinguishable endpoint. The \textsc{line} type would be appropariate for a \emph{row} or \emph{queue} that has no particularly distinguishable endpoints, but also is not a loop. The \textsc{loop} type would be appropriate for an \emph{equator} or for the \emph{border} of a region, which has no endpoints, but also loops back on itself. A value of \textsc{other} may be specified when none of the previously mentioned values are appropriate.
% paragraph line_type (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{area\_type}} % (fold)
\label{par:area_type}
This attribute is used to classify the entity based on a set of 2-dimensional primitive types. The \textsc{3-gon} type is used to indicate that the entity is triangular, possessing three distinguishable bounding edges and points such as a triangular \emph{slice} of pizza. Similarly, the \textsc{4-gon} type is used to indicate a 2-dimensional primitive with four bounding edges and points, such as a rectangular \emph{piece} of paper. The \textsc{disc} type is used for 2-dimensional entities with a single bounding edge, and no distinguishable points, such as a round \emph{coaster}. The \textsc{annulus} type is appropriate for a 2-dimensional entity, such as a compact \emph{disc}, that has two distinguishable bounding edges and no distinguishable bounding points. A value of \textsc{other} may be specified when none of the previously mentioned values are appropriate.
% paragraph area_type (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{volume\_type}} % (fold)
\label{par:volume_type}
This attribute is used to classify the entity based on a set of 3-dimensional primitive types.

The \textsc{tri\_prism} type should be used for 3-dimensional entities which can be thought of as 2-dimensional 3-gons that are extruded into a 3-dimensional prism with five distinguishable bounding surfaces and six distinguisable bounding points. A \emph{box} of Toblerone chocolates would be an appropriate entity to be tagged with the \textsc{tri\_prism} type.

The \textsc{rect\_prism} type is used for 3-dimensional entities that are 3-dimensionally extruded 4-gons with six distinguishable bounding surfaces and eight boinding points. This type includes entities such as a standard six-sided \emph{die}, a closed \emph{book} or \emph{tome}, or a prototypical \emph{box}. 

A value of \textsc{pyramid} is used for 3-dimensional entities with five distinguishable bounding surfaces, including a 4-gon and four 3-gons, in addition to five bounding points, including a single apex point.

A value of \textsc{sphere} is given to 3-dimensional spheroidal entities with no distinguishable bounding edges or vertices, such as a \emph{globe}, \emph{orange}, or \emph{ball}.

A value of \textsc{torus} is used for 3-dimensional entities with no distinguishable bounding edges or vertices, but is topologically distinct from a \textsc{sphere} type by virtue of having a hole. The distinction is analogous to the difference between the 2-dimensional \textsc{disc} and \textsc{annulus} primitive types, with \textsc{sphere} corresponding to the former and \textsc{torus} corresponding to the latter. A \emph{doughnut}, a hoola \emph{hoop}, or a wedding \emph{band} would all be examples of entities that would take a value of \textsc{torus} for their \texttt{volume\_type}.

A value of \textsc{cylinder} indicates a 3-dimensional entity with three distinguishable surfaces, two distinguishable bounding edges, and zero vertices. A soda \emph{can}, a dumbbell \emph{bar}, and a AA \emph{battery} are all examples that fall under this volume type.

A value of \textsc{cone} should be given for 3-dimensional entities with two distinguishable surfaces, one bounding edge, and a single apex point. An ice-cream \emph{cone}, a \emph{funnel}, or a coniferous \emph{tree} would all be appropriate entities to annotate with the \textsc{cone} type.

The \texttt{volume\_type} attribute is not intended to capture every entity perfectly. Rather, it is intended to identify distinguishable topological features which are accessed when the entity participates within a spatial configuration relation. If none of the previously described values are appropriate, a value of \textsc{other} may be specified.
% paragraph volume_type (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{left\_right}} % (fold)
\label{par:left_right}
This attribute is a bit that indicates whether the entity possesses an intrinsic axis of orientation whose polar extremes are `left' and `right'. An entity should be considered to possess an intrinsic left-right axis if it has left-hand and right-hand sides that are distinguishable independent of any frame of reference. One heuristic which may help to determine whether a spatial entity possesses an intrinsic \texttt{left\_right} axis is the linear-array-test. The linear-array-test can be employed by asking ``Could duplicates of this entity be arranged in a 1-dimensional array from `left-to-right', i.e., such that the `left' boundary belonging to each entity in the array abuts the `right' boundary of another?'' If the answer is ``no'', then the \texttt{left\_right} attribute should probably be annotated as \textsc{relative}; if ``yes'', the value would be likely be \textsc{intrinsic}.
% paragraph left_right (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{front\_back}} % (fold)
\label{par:front_back}
This attribute is similar to the \texttt{left\_right} attribute. A value of \textsc{intrinsic} indicates the entity possesses an intrinsic axis of orientation whose polar extremes are `front' and `back'. A value of \textsc{relative} indicates the opposite. The linear-array-test heuristic can be modified for this case such that arrangement of the array would be considered `front-to-back'.
% paragraph front_back (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{top\_bottom}} % (fold)
\label{par:top_bottom}
This attribute is similar, again, to both \texttt{left\_right} and \texttt{front\_back}. A value of \textsc{intrinsic} indicates the entity possesses an intrinsic axis of orientation whose polar extremes are `top' and `bottom'. The linear-array-test can be applied for this attribute as well to test if the entities can possibly be stacked `top-to-bottom'.
% paragraph top_bottom (end)

\paragraph{\texttt{c-sec\_axis}} % (fold)
\label{par:c_sec_axis}
This attribute is intended to identify the salient cross-sectional axis for 3-dimensional entities. The point of specifying the cross-sectional axis is to distinguish between spatial entities such as a typical twelve-ounce \emph{can} of soda, and a military-style \emph{submarine} that are both cylindrical, and both possess intrinsic left, right, front, back, top, and bottom boundaries, yet whose salient cross-sectional axes do not correspond to one another. For the soda \emph{can}, the salient cross-sectional axis---the axis along which the 2-dimensional circular base would be extruded---is the \textsc{top\_bottom} axis. For the \emph{submarine}, contrastively, it is the \textsc{front\_back} axis which corresponds to the cross-sectional axis along which the cylindrical primitive form would be extruded. Another way to conceptualize the salient cross-sectional axis would be to imagine slicing the entity into pieces as if to skewer the pieces like a kebab. Under this conceptualization, the axis that is aligned with the imaginary kebab is the axis which should be filled for the \texttt{c-sec\_axis} attribute.

\subsection{Orientation Signal Tag} % (fold)
\label{sub:orientation_signal_tag}

An orientation signal is taken to be some word or phrase that restricts the potential configurational interpretations of a spatial entity or group of spatial entities. Orientation signals always trigger configuration links, so if an annotator tags a orientation signal, then they are committing to also creating a configuration link. 

% @Cory - We would want every orientation signal to trigger a config link, no?

Examples of the former type are enumerated in \cref{ex:non_trigger_examples}.

\eenumsentence{
    \item On the large table \emph{stands} a lighted lamp.
    \label{ex:lamp_stands}
    \item \ldots \emph{lies} down on sofa.
    \label{ex:lies_sofa}
}\label{ex:non_trigger_examples}

Here, in \cref{ex:lamp_stands}, the signal \emph{stands} serves to adumbrate in what configuration the lamp is arranged individually. Because the lamp \emph{stands} rather than, e.g., \emph{lies down}, one immediately recognizes that the lamp is situated in such a way that its cross-sectional, top-bottom axis is aligned vertically.

Likewise, in \cref{ex:lies_sofa}, the signal \emph{lies} indicates that the entity---in this case an implicit spatial entity, which would need to be created via a non-consuming extent tag---is configured in such a way that its salient cross-sectional axis is horizontally aligned. 

Examples of the latter type are enumerated in \cref{ex:trigger_examples}.

\eenumsentence{
	\item MAURICE and HENRIETTE are in evening dress and sit facing each other \ldots
	\label{ex:sit_facing}
	\item In the foreground a table is spread, with flowers in the centre, bowls full of fruit, wine in decanters, oysters on platters \ldots
	\label{ex:foreground_table}
}\label{ex:trigger_examples}

%In the foreground a table is spread, with flowers [in] the [centre], bowls [full] of fruit, wine [in] decanters, oysters [on] platters ...; I am not sure about the annotation of "in the centre" above, "full of," or "on" above. I am going to leave this explanation blank for the moment.

\subsubsection{Orientation Signal Extents} % (fold)
\label{ssub:orientation_signal_extents}
% Explain what kinds of lexical items should be captured with the orientation signal tag here.
In general, whereas orientation entities will be nominals, orientation signals will belong to other parts of speech, e.g., verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. For phrasal verbs, take only the head verb as the extent for the orientation signal.

% subsubsection orientation_signal_extents (end)

\subsubsection{Orientation Signal Attributes} % (fold)
\label{ssub:orientation_signal_attributes}

The orientation signal tag has one attribute that annotators need to consider, as given in \cref{tab:orientation_signal}:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{attributes}
    \hline \texttt{id}                  & \texttt{os1}, \texttt{os2}, 
                                          \texttt{os3}, \ldots\\
    \hline \texttt{orientation\_type}   & \textsc{latitudinal}, \textsc{longitudinal}, \textsc{lateral}, \textsc{vertical}, \textsc{other}\\
\end{attributes}
\caption{Attributes for \textsc{orientation\_signal}}
\label{tab:orientation_signal}
\end{table}

\paragraph{\texttt{orientation\_type}} % (fold)
\label{par:orientation_type}
The \texttt{orientation\_type} attribute specifies an axis of orientation that is accessed by the orientation signal. It is employed to indicate how an entity is configured in an absolute sense (i.e., independently of any specific ground). The \textsc{latitudinal} value refers to the left-right axis, the \textsc{longitudinal} to the front-back axis, and the \textsc{vertical} to the top-bottom axis. We supply also the \textsc{lateral} value for cases in which a horizontal axis is accessed, but there is no distinction between the left-right and the front-back. The value of \textsc{other} should be selected for such cases as specify a configuration not covered by the remaining values.

% Go through each attribute, in depth, here.

% subsubsection other_tag_attributes (end)

\subsubsection{Orientation Signal Examples} % (fold)
\label{ssub:orientation_signal_examples}

Provided below, in \cref{ex:orientation_signals}, are sample annotations for extents to be tagged as \textsc{orientation\_signal}:

\eenumsentence{
    \item On the large table \signal{stands}{1} a lighted lamp.
    \label{ex:annot_stands}
    \item \ldots \signal{lies}{2} down on sofa.
    \label{ex:annot_lies}
    \item MAURICE and HENRIETTE are in evening dress and \signal{sit}{3} \signal{facing}{4} each other \ldots
	\label{ex:annot_sit_facing}
	\item In the foreground a table is spread, with flowers \signal{in}{5} the centre, bowls \signal{full}{6} of fruit, wine \signal{in}{7} decanters, oysters \signal{on}{8} platters \ldots
	\label{ex:annot_table}
}\label{ex:orientation_signals}

% We need to talk about how we are not actually capturing containment relations. E.g, for \emph{fruit in the bowl} and \emph{wine in decanters}, the $contains{container,containee}$ is a topological relation, distinct from the orientation relations we are capturing with configuration links, though there may be some conflation of the two. ISO-Space classifies \textsc{spatial\_signal} tags as topological, orientational, or both, but since OCDML is focused strictly on orientation, the cases where conflation does occur are going to be difficult.
